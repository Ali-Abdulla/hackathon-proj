# Service Agreement and Its Legal Regulation in Ukraine

## Legal Definition

Under a service agreement, one party (the service provider) undertakes, at the request of the other party (the customer), to provide a service that is consumed in the process of performing a specific action or engaging in specific activity, and the customer undertakes to pay the service provider for the specified service unless otherwise established by the agreement (Part 1 of Article 901 of the Civil Code of Ukraine).

## Form of the Agreement

According to the provisions of Article 208 of the Civil Code of Ukraine, transactions concluded between legal entities, between a natural and a legal entity, and transactions between natural persons amounting to twenty or more times the tax-free minimum income must be in written form.

Written form includes a classic paper contract with the signatures of the parties or an electronically signed document.

At the same time, according to Part 1 of Article 218 of the Civil Code of Ukraine, failure to comply with the written form of a transaction required by law does not render it invalid, except in cases specified by law.

## Public Contract

According to Part 1 of Article 633 of the Civil Code of Ukraine, a public contract is one in which one party, an entrepreneur, undertakes to sell goods, perform work, or provide services to anyone who applies to it (retail trade, public transport, communication services, medical, hotel, banking services, etc.).

A public contract is an offer.

According to Part 1 of Article 638 of the Civil Code of Ukraine, a contract is concluded by the offer of one party to enter into a contract and the acceptance of the offer (acceptance) by the other party.

## Doctrine of Venire Contra Factum Proprium

According to Clause 6 of Article 3 of the Civil Code of Ukraine, the doctrine of venire contra factum proprium (prohibition of contradictory behavior) operates; in Ukrainian law, this doctrine is manifested, in particular, in the qualification of certain behavioral acts (so-called conclusive actions) of a person - a party to the transaction as an expression of will, which indicates the conclusion of the transaction, including its approval.

Therefore, if the conclusive actions of a party indicate an intention to conclude a contract, such a party is not entitled to refer to the non-conclusion of the contract.

## Process of Concluding a Contract in Smart Posluhy

In Smart Posluhy, the following sequence of actions is used by the parties to the service agreement:

1. The business publishes a public offer on its website, indicating which services it provides and stating that when a customer contacts it, it updates the smart contract {smart contract address} by calling the `addServiceType()` function, specifying additional characteristics of the service, after which the customer has the opportunity to mint an NFT.

2. Minting an NFT is considered acceptance by the customer of the terms of the offer and undertaking the obligation to pay for the service.

3. In case of receiving the service but not paying for it, the business has the right to go to court to protect its violated rights.

Thus, minting an NFT is the acceptance of the offer by means of conclusive actions (actions of a person that indicate their will to establish a legal relationship, not in the form of oral or written expression of will, but through behavior from which a specific intention can be inferred).

That is, minting an NFT indicates that the service agreement is concluded.
